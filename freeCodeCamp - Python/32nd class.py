# using web services
# data on the web
# with the HTTP Request/Responde well understood and well supported,
# there was a natural move toward exchanging data between programs using
# these protocols
# we needed to come up with an agreed way to represent data going between
# applications and across networks. There are two commonly used
# formats: XML and JSON


# sending data across the "NET"
# php array <-> { "name" : "chuck", "phone" : "303-4456"}
# Python Dictionary <-> { "name" : "chuck", "phone" : "303-4456"}
# JavaScript Object <-> { "name" : "chuck", "phone" : "303-4456"}
# Java HashMap <-> { "name" : "chuck", "phone" : "303-4456"}

# a.k.a "Wire protocol" - What we send on the "wire"
